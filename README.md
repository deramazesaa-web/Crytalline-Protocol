# Crytalline-Protocol
Next-gen governance replacing "Code is Law" with "Logic is Physics." Built on Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory and deontic logic to create Super-Subjects. The protocol eliminates "Governance Slime" and logical entropy, making transactions physically impossible if they contradict the system’s axioms. Formal safety, beyond audits.
